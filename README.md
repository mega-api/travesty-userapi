# travesty-userapi
This library lets you turn your account into a robot/user bot

# Contributing
You are welcome to contribute to this mini project. I will have you know that I will no longer support the userapi after travesty goes into beta (assuming there's bot support) if travesty does not people logging into their user accounts to automate things. This is simply a workaround until we get the ability to create bots.
You may not publish this project as your own and you may not use it with malicious intent or with the goal of overwheling travesty as a platform. If this becomes the case I will easily STOP all development efforts and bring down the project.

# Documentation
It'll be coming soon. If you're seeing this repo then I decided to open-source it. I probably asked the guy who runs travesty if that was alright before doing so. I'll add some docs as soon as I can.
